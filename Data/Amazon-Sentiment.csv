101,"Ich nutze diesen Bohrer als Zweitbohrer in Ergänzung zu meinem DDF 482Z. So habe ich bspw. einen Bohrer zum Vorbohren und einem zum Schrauben etc.Die Schlagfunktion habe ich bisher nicht ernsthaft benutzt - da ich einen Bohrhammer habe und dazu eben die DDF482 ohne Schlagfunktion habe ich das hier in diesem Fall nur ""mitgenommen"" um alle Varianten in meinem Arsenal zu haben.Für diesen wie meinen anderen Makita-Bohrer kann ich nur sagen, dass ich sehr zufrieden bin, die Geräte einen hochwerten und verlässlichen Eindruck machen und ich damit auch schon viel Schabernack getrieben habe - von Holzverarbeitung über Stein-Bohrungen, Bohren mit Forstner-Bohrern bis hin zum Durchbohren von Metall-Gewindestangen.Positiv hervorheben möchte ich noch, dass dieser Bohrer neben dem Drehmoment-Wahlrad ein zweites Einstellrad besitzt, über das geregelt wird, ob man bohren, schrauben oder schlagbohren möchte. Einstellung ""Schrauben"" bedeutet dabei gewissermaßen ""beachte das Drehmoment-Wahlrad"" und ""Bohren"" bedeutet ""ignoriere die Einstellung, volle Pulle"". Das ist sehr praktisch, wenn ihr bspw. zwischen Bohren und Schrauben hin- und her wechselt: Dann müsst ihr nicht immer umständlich die Drehmoment-Stufen wechseln (""welche hatte ich nochmal?"") sondern mit einem Dreh zwischen ""Volle Pulle"" und eurer favorisierten Drehmoment-Stufe hin- und her wechseln.Nachteil bei dem Drehrad ist leider, dass es für meine etwas größeren Hände etwas schwer zu greifen / drehen ist. Insofern ist die Freude über diese etwas coole Funktion leider etwas getrübt.",de,"I use this drill as a second drill in addition to my DDF 482Z.

I would also like to positively point out that this drill has a second dial in addition to the torque dial, which controls whether you want to drill, screw or impact drill. The ""screw"" setting means ""pay attention to the torque dial"" and ""drill"" means ""ignore the setting, full speed"". This is very practical when you switch back and forth between drilling and screwing, for example: Then you don't always have to awkwardly change the torque levels (""which one did I have again?"") but instead switch back and forth between ""full throttle"" and your favourite torque level with one turn.The disadvantage of the rotary wheel is unfortunately that it is somewhat difficult for my somewhat larger hands to grip / turn.

Der DHP482 wird nicht von der Makita Werkzeug GmbH Deutschland verkauft, so dass auch keine Garantieverlängerung auf drei Jahre so wie bei anderen Makita Produkten möglich ist. Diese Information kam gerade innerhalb von 4h vom Makita Support nach einer Anfrage über das Online-Formular.Mit beiden negativen Punkten kann ich leben und werde das Gerät sicherlich nicht zurück senden, allerdings sollte man das wissen, bevor man es kauft.Nachtrag: In anderen Bewertungen werden zwei weitere negative Punkte angesprochen:1. Spiel im Bohrfutter - So etwas ist bei dem Gerät, das ich erhalten habe, nicht mit bloßem Auge zu erkennen.2.

119,"Zu den Bildern:1. Bild = die neue Makita2. Bild = älteres LXT-Gerät3. Bild original Akku Makita 1815 18V/1,5 AhWie auf den Bildern zu sehen ist, steht an dem neuen Gerät ein Metall-Nippel hervor, welcher das Einschieben des Akkus verhindert (s. orange Markierung auf den Bildern!)Die Führungsschiene an dieser Stelle muss bei den Akkus aufgesägt oder geschnitten werden, damit man den Akku auch tatsächlich benutzen kann!Bei dem älteren Gerät (hier eine Reciprosäge) ist genau dieser Nippel nicht vorhanden und auch bei meinen sonstigen 18V Makita-Akku-Geräten der LXT-Serie!Man sollte doch erwarten dürfen, dass die 18V-Akkus derselben Serie auch untereinander auf alle Geräte passen!Durch das öffnen des Akkus an der Führungsschiene wird diese natürlich wesentlich instabiler, so dass zu befürchten steht, dass genau diese Seite vorzeitig brechen wird und den Akku dann unbrauchbar macht!Und dasselbe Problem wird natürlich mit ALLEN Akkus, die man auf diesem Gerät verwenden will, auftreten!!!Weiterhin kann ich keinerlei Unterschied zwischen den Drehzahlen der beiden Gänge feststellen, was aber gerade beim Schrauben oftmals wichtig werden kann, um Schraubenköpfe nicht ""rund zu drehen""!Rechts-/Linkslauf funktionieren, ebenfalls die Hammerfunktion und Drehmoment-Einstellung.Das Gerät ist relativ schwer, liegt aber sehr gut in der Hand. Und auch ansonsten ist der Akkuschrauber sehr stabil und kraftvoll, wie man es von einem Profigerät und besonders von einer Makita erwartet!Wäre die Sache mit dem Akku nicht, würde ich 4 von 5 Sternen vergeben, wegen des Getriebes, das die Drehzahl nicht reduziert, weil ich diese Funktion eher selten benutze und man die Drehzahl auch sehr gut über den Auslöser regulieren kann!Ansonsten ist der Akkuschrauber sehr gut und tut was er soll, liegt gut in der Hand und das Gewicht verleiht einem auch das Gefühl von guter Kontrolle über das Werkzeug.Aber an JEDEM Akku eine Sollbruchstelle ausgerechnet an der Haupt-Führungsschiene hinzufügen zu müssen, geht aus meiner Sicht gar nicht! Die original-Akkus und auch jene aus dem Zubehör sind zu teuer, als dass man sie schon vor der ersten Benutzung beschädigen und destabilisieren will!!!Das hat mich dann doch ziemlich enttäuscht, zumal es seitens Makita meines Wissens keinerlei Mitteilungen gibt, dass in dem Bereich der Akkus etwas geändert wurde und die ""älteren"" Akkus aus derselben Serie nicht ohne weiteres auf neuere Geräte passen ...In wie weit das Problem auch bei Akkus aus dem Zubehör auftreten, kann ich nicht sagen, weil ich immer die originalen Akkus von Makita verwende.Ich hoffe diese Rezension war für euch hilfreich?!MfG",de,"About the pictures:1st picture = the new Makita2. Picture = older LXT unit3. As you can see in the pictures, there is a metal nipple on the new tool that prevents the battery from being inserted (see orange marking on the pictures!) The guide rail at this point must be sawn or cut on the batteries so that you can actually use the battery!This nipple is not present on the older tool (in this case a reciprocating saw) or on any of my other 18V Makita battery tools in the LXT series! You should be able to expect that the 18V batteries in the same series fit together on all tools!By opening the battery on the guide rail, it naturally becomes much more unstable, so that it is to be feared that exactly this side will break prematurely and then make the battery unusable!And the same problem will naturally occur with ALL batteries that one wants to use on this device!!!!Furthermore, I can't detect any difference between the speeds of the two gears, which can often be important, especially when screwing, in order to avoid ""rounding"" screw heads! Right/left rotation works, as does the hammer function and torque setting.The device is relatively heavy, but fits very well in the hand. And also otherwise, the cordless screwdriver is very stable and powerful, as you would expect from a professional device and especially from a Makita!If it weren't for the thing with the battery, I would give it 4 out of 5 stars, because of the gear that does not reduce the speed, because I use this function rather rarely and you can also regulate the speed very well via the trigger!Otherwise, the cordless screwdriver is very good and does what it is supposed to do, lies well in the hand and the weight also gives you the feeling of good control over the tool.But to have to add a predetermined breaking point to EVERY battery on the main guide rail, of all places, is not acceptable in my view at all! The original batteries and also those from the accessories are too expensive to want to damage and destabilise them before they are even used for the first time!!!This has disappointed me quite a bit,

Der Techniker den ich in der Leitung hatte sagte mir, dass ein zu starkes Spiel für ein neues Gerät ungewöhnlich sein und ich das Gerät am besten wieder zurück geben solle.Der Verkäufer (Netbuy24) zeigte sich kulant und nahm das Gerät zurück, wobei er darauf verwiesen hat, dass das von mir reklamierte Spiel vollkommen normal sei und alle seine Geräte dieses Typs dieses Spiel aufweisen. Dies sei auch so von Makita gewollt, da der Kopf ja beim Schlagbohren mitschwingen müsse.Das hat mich doch sehr stutzig gemacht! Daraufhin bin ich zum örtlichen Makita Händler. Dieser erklärte mir, dass dieses Spiel nicht normal sei und mir exakt das gleiche Gerät ohne dieses Spiel zeigte.Am Besten es macht sich jeder selbst ein Bild und schaut sich das Video an.

The technician I had on the line told me that too much play was unusual for a new machine and that I should return the machine. The seller (Netbuy24) was very accommodating and took the machine back, pointing out that the play I had complained about was completely normal and that all of his machines of this type had this play. This was also the way Makita wanted it, as the head had to swing when drilling, which made me very suspicious! So I went to my local Makita dealer. He explained to me that this play was not normal and showed me exactly the same tool without this play. It's best for everyone to see for themselves and watch the video.

335,"Review DHP482 und Vergleich mit M18CBLPDEin Akkuschrauber ist eines der essenziellsten Elektrowerkzeuge, die man haben sollte. Das nächste wäre dann eine Handkreissäge. Ihr wollt also nun wissen, wie gut dieser Schlagbohrschrauber ist? Nun ja, für den Heimgebrauch ist er auf jeden Fall hervorragend. Wir haben denselben auch in der Firma. Am besten kann man ein Produkt bewerten, wenn man auch noch andere gleichwertige Geräte mit diesem vergleicht. Also los.-  Generell.Im Großen und Ganzen ein Akkuschrauber durch und durch. Man sollte das Schlagwerk nicht verwenden, wenn es nicht unbedingt notwendig ist. Das Drehmoment im Harten Schraubfall ist identisch mit dem Mainstream, sowie auch des M18CBLPD, den ich hier mit dem Makita DHP482 vergleichen möchte.- Akkuplattformen.Wenn ihr mit diesem Gerät in die Makita Plattform einsteigen wollt, kann ich euch das nicht verübeln.Gefallen tut mit vor allem der simple und geschmeidige Wechsel der Makita Akkus. Bei Milwaukee muss man hart zusammendrücken und fest ziehen, bis sich der Akkupack löst. Ein Nachteil bei den BL18xx Akkus ist aber das Plastikgehäuse. Es scheint nicht so stabil zu sein wie bei Team Rot. Und einen gummierten Boden, um Kratzer auf Akku und Oberfläche zu vermeiden hat es auch nicht. Ich habe das provisorisch mit Isolierband gelöst. Wenn man Akkus mit über 6Ah sucht, ist Makita nicht zu empfehlen.Ladezeiten sind in etwa gleich aber der Makita Schnelllader bläst die ganze Zeit mit einem Lüfter was echt nervig ist. Bei dem Teil kann man auch nicht erkennen, wann er fertig ist. Er bläst einfach die ganze Zeit. Der Milwaukee Lader hat wenigstens ein leises „Ladegeräusch“ das aufhört, wenn er fertig ist.Jetzt zu den Akkuschraubern selbst.- Gewicht.Der Milwaukee CBLPD ist etwas leichter als der DHP482.- GeräuschpegelDer Makita klingt wie ein Transformator beim Anlaufen. Bei maximaler Drehzahl ist aber der Milwaukee lauter.- AbzugDer Makita Abzug gefällt mir besser. Er hat einen kleineren Weg bis das Gerät anläuft und der Schrauber muss sich nicht drehen, damit das Licht angeht.- Niedrigste UmdrehungszahlMilwaukee:  1 Umdrehung in 3 Sekunden (1. Gang)Makita :  1 Umdrehung in 1-1,5 Sekunden (1. Gang)- GangwechselBeide können mit 1 Hand gewechselt werden (wenn man die Geräte gegen den Körper drückt), der Makita hat einen etwas angenehmeren Gangwechsel weil die Ergonomie besser ist.- GriffstückDer Makita ist besser was die Ergonomie angeht (Handschuhgröße M). Wenn man größere Hände hat ist der Milwaukee aber wahrscheinlich besser.- KupplungDie Makita Kupplung ist besser.  Sie hat zwei Drehräder zum Einstellen und ist deshalb bei häufigerem Umstellen zwischen Schrauben und Bohren angenehmer.  Der hintere Ring (Bohren, Schrauben, Schlagbohren) lässt sich aber nur recht schwer drehen.- BaugrößeDas führt uns zum nächsten Punkt, Länge und Breite. Der Makita hat ~200mm Länge, wahrscheinlich wegen dem extra Kupplungsring. Unten bei dem Akku ist der Makita am breitesten, wahrscheinlich etwa 5mm mehr als der Akku eh schon hat.Milwaukee gewinnt mit ~170mm Länge.- SchnellspannfutterDas Vollmetall Schnellspannfutter von Milwaukee ist natürlich dem Makita überlegen. Es wirkt robuster und ist besser zu spannen, da die Klicks beim Festspannen recht gut zu hören sind. Die Klicks von Makita sind etwas schwerer zu hören.- HerstellungslandZumindest ist der Makita noch in Europa hergestellt, Made in Romania. Der Milwaukee hingegen in P.R.C = People's Republic of China (Made in China). Falls ihr Made in Germany haben wollt, schaut euch eher bei Bosch Blau, Festool, Mafell und Fein um.- ExtrasDer Makita hat keinen Bithalter. Der ist beim Milwaukee aber nur begrenzt nützlich da nur lange Bits sicher darin sind. Makitas Gürtelclip wird nicht angeschraubt geliefert. Der von Milwaukee schon. Die Schraube ist ebenfalls mit Loctite gesichert.",de,"Review DHP482 and comparison with M18CBLPDEA cordless screwdriver is one of the most essential power tools to have. The next would be a hand-held circular saw. So now you want to know how good this impact drill is? Well, it's definitely excellent for home use. We also have the same one at work. The best way to evaluate a product is to compare it with other equivalent devices. Generally speaking, it's a cordless screwdriver through and through. You should not use the impact mechanism if it is not absolutely necessary. The torque in the hard case is identical to the mainstream, as well as the M18CBLPD, which I would like to compare here with the Makita DHP482.- Battery platforms.If you want to get into the Makita platform with this tool, I can't blame you.What I like most is the simple and smooth change of Makita batteries. With Milwaukee, you have to squeeze hard and pull firmly until the battery pack comes off. One disadvantage of the BL18xx batteries is the plastic housing. It doesn't seem to be as sturdy as Team Red's. And it doesn't have a rubberised bottom to prevent scratches on the battery and the surface. I solved this temporarily with insulating tape. If you are looking for batteries with more than 6Ah, Makita is not to be recommended. Charging times are about the same, but the Makita fast charger blows all the time with a fan, which is really annoying. You can't tell when it's finished either. It just blows all the time. The Milwaukee loader at least has a quiet 'charging' noise that stops when it's done.Now for the cordless screwdrivers themselves.- Weight.The Milwaukee CBLPD is a bit lighter than the DHP482.- Noise levelThe Makita sounds like a transformer when it starts up. At maximum speed, however, the Milwaukee is louder.- TriggerI like the Makita trigger better. It has a shorter travel before the tool starts and the screwdriver does not have to rotate for the light to come on. Lowest RPMMilwaukee: 1 revolution in 3 seconds (1st gear)Makita : 1 revolution in 1-1.5 seconds (1st gear)- Gear changeBoth can be changed with 1 hand (if you press the tools against your body), the Makita has a slightly more comfortable gear change because the ergonomics are better.- HandleThe Makita is better in terms of ergonomics (glove size M). If you have bigger hands, the Milwaukee is probably better.- ClutchThe Makita clutch is better.  It has two dials for adjustment and is therefore more comfortable for frequent switching between screwing and drilling.  However, the rear ring (drilling, screwing, impact drilling) is quite difficult to turn.- SizeThis leads us to the next point, length and width. The Makita is ~200mm long, probably because of the extra coupling ring. At the bottom of the battery, the Makita is the widest, probably about 5mm more than the battery already has.Milwaukee wins with ~170mm length.- Quick release chuckThe full metal quick release chuck from Milwaukee is of course superior to the Makita. It seems more robust and is easier to clamp, as the clicks can be heard quite well when tightening. The Makita clicks are a little harder to hear.- Country of manufactureAt least the Makita is still made in Europe, Made in Romania. The Milwaukee, on the other hand, is made in P.R.C = People's Republic of China (Made in China). If you want Made in Germany, look around at Bosch Blue, Festool, Mafell and Fein.- ExtrasThe Makita has no bit holder.

Nach dem Montieren des neuen Bohrfutters (was sich als etwas problematisch herausgestellt hat, da das alte doch ziemlich fest - ich nehme an mit LockTite gesichert - festgesessen ist) war es SOFORT vorbei mit dem ""rumgeeiere"" des mitgelieferten Makita Originalzubehörs (das ist totaler Schrott).Im beiliegenden Video sehen Sie den absolut runden (das einzige, was da wackelt bin ich mit der Kamera) Lauf dank des neuen Röhm Bohrfutters -> erstklassig und absolut überzeugend! (beim Bohrer handelt es sich i.ü. um einen neuen Garant VHM-Bohrer, max. Toleranz H7 (wenige Mikrometer, Schaft: H6) - dieser ist also (für das Auge) 100% ""gerade"" und darf als Referenz / Ersatz für einen Prüfstab herhalten).-> ich kann die (wenigen) erbosten Rezensionen hier verstehen, die das Gerät abwerten wg. des Rundlaufs. Das Problem liegt hier aber am Bohrfutter - und kann leicht selbst behoben werden. Für den Premium-Anspruch von Makita sollte dem Paket aber in der Tat etwas besseres beiliegen, daher gibt es von mir nur 3 Sterne (das Gerät an sich, sobald es denn sauber läuft, verdient klar 5 ***** !)",de,"                    The media could not be loaded.

I bought the Röhm Supra-SK E drill chuck (1/2""-20 mount). After fitting the new chuck (which turned out to be a bit of a problem, as the old one was stuck quite firmly - I assume secured with LockTite) it was IMMEDIATELY over with the ""bumbling around"" of the original Makita accessories supplied (which are total rubbish).In the enclosed video you can see the absolutely round (the only thing that wobbles there is me with the camera) run thanks to the new Röhm chuck -> first class and absolutely convincing! (The drill is usually a new Garant solid carbide drill, max. tolerance H7 (a few micrometres, shank: H6) - this is therefore 100% ""straight"" (to the eye) and can be used as a reference / replacement for a test rod) -> I can understand the (few) angry reviews here that devalue the tool because of the concentricity.

charger with this drill  just the above listed items i would recommend buying a case or a carry bag of some kind to keep the drill  battery  and charger together onto how the drill performs i ve had 2 separate moments of panic which turned out to be fail safes built into the drill  which i will share with you guys so you don t panic like i did while on the  screw  function  which is obviously named  once the screw  or whatever you are screwing in  has reached its optimum tightness indicated by your torque setting  the number dial  the drill will click and refuse to turn  instead of continuously turning like the drill or hammer setting  in order to prevent the screw or the drill bit stripping the second failsafe i m not quite sure how it happened but i was low on battery and had been using the drill for a few hours in the hot sun and the drill stopped moving  but the light still came on  i m assuming this was an overheating fail safe or just low battery  as once i left the battery charging and cooling down  as well as the drill  it worked again this drill annihilates any task it has been presented with so far  its drilled through wood like a knife through butter  kept up with my father s corded drill when drilling into masonry  and screws things in like it is child s play the drill comes with an attachable hook which slightly overshoots the bottom of the drill  putting it on a slight lean  but it isn t too annoying  the only other thing with this drill is a flathead crosshead drill bit  that is it i haven t needed to yet but the drill s inner parts are easily accessible and replaceable conclusion  if you want a good drill or are planning lots of working where drilling or screwing is needed  buy it  and a battery or two  and a charger    if you are doing light work  i would probably say buy a cheaper drill with all the parts needed  as this drill is definitely more aimed at bigger jobs more than small bits and bobs ,short version review fantastic

460,"I feel I can review this item with the utmost confidence because even though I've only just purchased this one, these are issued to us at work and I use mine daily.It's a really good bit of kit. Not perfect (despite the 5 stars...perhaps 4.5 would have been more apt) but not too far off for what it is. Obviously, you won't get the power of an high-end corded hammer drill, nor will you get the compactness of it's smaller screwdriver cousin. What you do get though is a really good all-rounder.There is an hammer option, which is actually quite powerful (in fact, I've also bought a new 18v Dewalt drill recently and I find the hammer option to be more powerful on this). It will drill relatively easily into all but the hardest of materials. I would have said ALL until recently, when I was on the verge of tears trying to hang a gate post on a wall of Accrington brick, which, of course, just laughed at me. No doubt you'd ask why not just go for the mortar joint's...well that was what the last three scoundrels before me did, leaving me a tricky one.! Of course I got there in the end, but I digress. Back on topic, It will drill into concrete and most building materials without much issue.The screwdriver option isn't quite as powerful as it's Dewalt  but is still much more powerful than an electric screwdriver and can be toned down for more delicate operations.It looks good too, which might not be an important consideration to most, but those who pride themselves on a good looking workshop, will know it's no bad thing to have nice looking tools sat on the wall.Although this doesn't come with a battery or charger, if you do decide to purchase both as well, the 4ah battery will last ages and the charger won't take long to recharge your battery (though it is a bit cumbersome).In short, I got mine for free at work but still decided to buy one anyway. Need I say more? ...You won't be disappointed.",en,"I feel I can review this item with the utmost confidence because even though I've only just purchased this one, these are issued to us at work and I use mine daily.It's a really good bit of kit.

463,"Where to start ....I own a DTD152 impact driver and a DHP453 combi drill alongside other Makita tools.  I found the impact driver a bit too powerful on occasions (especially for smaller screws) so thought getting a single drill somewhere in between the two tools above so that I would only need to lug one around with me.There is no question the hammer action of the 482 is better than the 453.  On paper another 20Nm and the test drill I did on an old flag stone definitely proved it to be a step upHowever, for larger diameter/longer screws it feels wanting against the 152. It obviously would being a much lower power device.So, what do I do?  I will definitely flog the 453 on an internet auction site and had intended to do the same with the 152.  Think I'll wait a bit and see how the 482 performs in the real world before bidding it a fond farewellThe 482 is a good compromise re length at 208mm.  (152 = 187mm, 453 = 240mm)  It also DOESN'T feel heavy and DOES feel balanced in the hand.Got a job tomorrow that will test it so will come back and update",en,"Where to start ....I own a DTD152 impact driver and a DHP453 combi drill alongside other Makita tools.

466,Got this from Amazon warehouse deals for less than half the price of the 'trade' sellers found on industrial estates. It didn't have a box but was brand new - as the box was going in the bin I didn't mind that saving!It's spot on. If you are a carpenter if will see you well. Yes it has bushes - but they cost buttons and take two minutes to change. Plus for the money this is a no brainer. Plenty of power for drilling - and not too heavy. Whilst still having that quality trade feel about it (I reckon I could drop it and it would keep going). For heavier work you want to be using a SDS drill anyway!Only thing i didn't like is that no replacement bushes in the pack! But they cost about £2 so no great shakes.But it with confidence - it's makita. I don't do screwing with it as I have an impact for that.

Como podéis ver en el vídeo lo hce solamente en la velocidad 2, en la 1 va perfectamenteMe atrevería a decir incluso que la broca no va recta y equilibrada (hoy ya he partido 3 brocas en lo que voy de jornada) pero solo lo hace en algunas ocasiones cuando va a alta velocidad (siempre en posición 2)Por ahora el panorama y las expectativas  son bastante pobres. Ya escribiré cómo termina la película..Ergonómicamente me gusta mucho y el que tenga las 3 funciones en el selector (percutor, destornillador con embrague y taladro) le hace. Muy versátil (de ahí las 3 estrellas por ahora)EDITO: no ha pasado un mes desde que lo compre y el taladro huele mal y echa algo de humo por la zona del motor. Está claro que algo no va bien por ahí y no voy a seguir usándolo porque estoy seguro de que en breve dejará de funcionar. Comienzo el proceso de devolución; menos mal que lo compre en Amazon..",es,"                    Die Medien konnten nicht geladen werden.
